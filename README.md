Goal: to simulate a movie rental/purchase software. Input a text file then create a catalog of movies to choose from. The user will choose from a few options, to insert a title to sell, to print out the catalog, to view the cart, or to purchase a movie. This will add any items to the shopping cart and calulate a total owed. Use the menus to navigate through the movie catalog. When a movie is purchased it will be deleted from the catalog. 

Download the code and select the build and run option through code blocks. The initial catalog will already be input into the system so there is no text file that needs to be input.

There are no third-party libraries that need to be installed.

This code runs on C++11. To use this in code blocks google c++11 on code blocks.
